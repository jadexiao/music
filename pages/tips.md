This is a list of ukulele tips that have helped me play better. Some of these are conventional wisdom; some are based on my own observations.

<p class="tip-category">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuning</p>

{: .tip }
Check intonation at the 12<sup>th</sup> fret.

It can be hard to tell whether the ukulele is in tune from the sound of open strings. To check, play the strings at the 12<sup>th</sup> fret or higher since this will amplify small imperfections in intonation. It also guarantees that you'll stay in tune when playing high up the neck.

<p class="tip-category">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding the ukulele</p>

{: .tip }
Hold the ukulele in a way where it won't fall down when you let go of the neck.

You cannot play easily if you have to "catch" the uke every time there's a chord change. Typically, this means you should clamp down on the body with your right forearm; but if you're lazy, you can rest it against a raised left knee or lay it across your lap like a guitar.

{: .tip }
Don't tilt the ukulele or pull the neck back to get a view of the fretboard.

Tilting the uke puts additional stress on the fretting hand because the wrist has to curve more. Pulling back on the neck will set it up to rebound when you let go to change chords.

<p class="tip-category">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fretting</p>

{: .tip }
You don't have to press hard.

Experiment with the minimum amount of pressure you have to apply to get a clear sound. It shouldn't be very much. This means you can play for longer without getting tired.

{: .tip }
Press directly behind the fret.

This is tied to the above tip. The closer your finger is to the fret, the less pressure it has to apply to hold the string down. Also, you will get more accurate pitch and less fret buzz.

{: .tip }
Pay attention to the thumb.

Keep the thumb "light" and ready to move along the fretboard, instead of sticking it to one place.

<p class="tip-category">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fingerpicking</p>

{: .tip }
Learn from classical guitar.

Everything I know about having good tone comes from classical guitar, from nail maintenance to finger mechanics. The main takeaway is that fingerpicking should not be thought of as plucking the string outwards perpendicular to the body of the ukulele but as pushing the string with control, driven by the big knuckle. There are lots of great reference videos on YouTube, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuq1iSFSGhU" target="_blank">this one</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DempcyiMMuI" target="_blank">this one</a>.

{: .tip }
Clean under fingernails.

Make sure there is no debris under fingernails that can make contact with the string.

{: .tip }
Keep the skin on your fingertips hydrated.

Moist skin grips the string better than dry skin and produces a meatier sound.

<p class="tip-category">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Practice</p>

{: .tip }
Understand the difference between reactive and preventative practice.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWb6RHPlhcY" target="_blank">This video</a> explains the difference. Basically, muscle memory is the _proportion_ of times you can play something correctly. Succeeding 20 times and failing 5 times is better than succeeding 50 times and failing 50 times. The more you fail, the more you train yourself to play incorrectly. Once you internalize this, you will begin to practice more mindfully knowing that every attempt counts.

{: .tip }
Practice while watching something.

Once you've gotten used to the mechanics of a technique, practicing it in the background while watching TV or a YouTube video is an efficient way of getting reps in.

{: .tip }
Practice with a metronome.

It's not fun but developing a reliable and accurate internal clock is a must. You don't _have_ to listen to clicks. I prefer the voice mode or a drum track.

<p class="tip-category">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Motivation</p>

{: .tip }
Follow the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HawaiiMusicSupplyTUS" target="_blank">HawaiiMusicSupply</a> podcast.

I get so much joy and inspiration from watching Corey, Kalei, and assorted guests. They are the best ukulele ambassadors ever.

{: .tip }
Commit to making monthly videos.

This is the ultimate accountability hack because it forces you to practice and improve.
